# 🌱 Farm-to-Campus Produce Alerter

## 📌 Problem
Local farmers often have surplus produce that goes unsold, while students want fresh, affordable, local produce. This gap leads to food waste for farmers and missed opportunities for students.

## 💡 Solution
Farm-to-Campus Produce Alerter is a simple notification web app where farmers can post daily available produce, and students can easily check what’s fresh and ready to pick up.

## 🎯 MVP Scope

- Displays a list of produce items and daily updates.  
- Farmers/students can view fresh availability with ease.
